I started this to note progress in relearning web-dev. I started this project on Feb 11th, to teach myself things from the ground up
as well as on top of things I already knew. My primary focus is learning CSS since I am very new to lnguage.

For now, I am following SuperSimpleDev's 6 hr YouTube course "HTML & CSS - Beginner to Pro".
I am replicating his excersises in my own code, these excersises are in "prac" files numbered in order from the first excersise
I choose to due and so on. named files such as buttons.html an text.html are files that follows along with the respected topic
featured in the video, mostly copying and unerstaning the code from a lesson so I can practice with my own code in the "prac" files

this is the link to the paticular video - https://youtu.be/G3e-cpL7ofc?si=aEjx_-oaQpkobPcQ
